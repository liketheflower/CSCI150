1. distribution law

from this example, you can get the conclusion by yourself.  
   (1 + 2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9)    
  +(9 + 8 +7 +6 +5 +4 +3 +2 +1)
  =10 +10 +10+10+10+10+10 ...
  =10*9
  
 (1 + 2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9)    
  +(9 + 8 +7 +6 +5 +4 +3 +2 +1)
  =2*(1 + 2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9)
  
  We can get (1 + 2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9)=10*9/2
